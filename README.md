# Asteriod Game

This game was written by OJ Adeyemi on November 2021.

This was my final computer science project in high school. 

This was written with python using pygame modules.

## Objective
 The objective of the game is to avoid the falling asteriods coming your way as a spaceship and get as high of a score as you can get

There are special powerups that can aid your journey including. Each collison with an asteriod will cost you a live.

The game is endless but gets difficult over time. Your goal is to survive as long as possible and try to get as high of a score as you can get.
